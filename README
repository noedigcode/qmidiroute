QMidiRoute is a MIDI event router and filter. MIDI note, control change,
program change and pitch bend events are logged, and can be filtered, 
redirected and transformed into other events according to MIDI maps 
defined as tabs in the main control surface. 
To start, click the 'Add MIDI map' button. You can copy midi MAPS into new
tabs using the 'Clone MIDI map' button. All MIDI maps can be saved in
a .qma text file.
QMidiRoute can be started using the following options:

   --portCount <num>         Number of Output Ports [2]
   --file <filename>         Open Map File <filename>
   -c <alsaClientName>       ALSA client name


Requirements
------------

Packages required for building from source on Ubuntu 22.04:

- autoconf
- libasound2-dev
- qtbase5-dev
- qtbase5-dev-tools


After fresh Git clone
---------------------

After a fresh Git clone on your system, first run:

autoreconf -i


Building
--------

If Qt5 is not specified, it will try to use Qt4.

It is useful to create a build directory and run the build commands from
there so the source directories are not cluttered with build files.

mkdir build
cd build

./configure --enable-qt5
make

The built binary should be under src/qmidiroute

If using a separate build directory, translations may fail. If you require this,
copy src/translations to build/src/translations before running make.

Finally, you can install QMidiRoute system-wide with

sudo make install


For more instructions about compiling and installing this application please
refer to the INSTALL file.
